## Implementation Guidelines 

To ensure quality and maintainability, we follow these steps for each task:
1. Implement features in the order listed in this todo
2. Review implementation
   - Code quality check
   - Feature functionality verification
3. Commit changes after successful review
4. Move to the next task in sequence

## Notes
- Priority should be given to completing the monitoring implementation
- Testing should be implemented alongside new features
- Documentation should be updated as features are completed
